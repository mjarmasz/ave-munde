Baby steps in machine learning

I really enjoy learning new things, and am excited to dive back into machine learning, especially deep learning, after haven taken an almost 14 year break from artificial intelligence.

My background is in symbolic techniques for natural language processing. I am excited to be able to start programming convolutional neural networks.
